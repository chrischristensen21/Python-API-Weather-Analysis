# Python API Weather Analysis

## Background

This project uses python and the OpenWeatherMap API analyze the weather of 500+ cities across the world at varying distance from the equator. It then uses gmaps and the Google Places API to narrow down the list of cities to those with fairly ideal weather conditions. It then uses the filtered list to create a heatmap of hotels within 5000 meters of the given coordinates.
